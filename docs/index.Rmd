### Dynamic paragraph

Of the gun death victims from 1985 to 2018, `r victims_less_than_one()` were less than one years old. The percentage of male offenders is `r male_offenders_percentage()`% and the percentage of female offenders is `r female_offenders_percentage()`%. The percentage of Black victims is `r black_victim_percentage()`%. The percentage of gun deaths caused by handguns is `r handgun_used_percentage()`%. Through these values, we can see various trends in the data that show the severity of gun violence in the U.S.

``` {r echo=FALSE}
library("knitr")
kable(gender)
```
From the table seen above, we can see that most mass shootings are done by males (over 200). Females account for the least number of mass shootings (only 9). However, we need to note that the table does not account for people who identify outside of the gender binary, and therefore the data may have limitations or inaccuracies.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!!
